# Exercises for BIOENG 456: Controlling Behavior in Animals and Robots
Welcome to BIOENG 456: **Co**ntrolling **B**ehavior in **A**nimals and **R**obots (CoBAR)! In this course, we will use [FlyGym](https://github.com/NeLy-EPFL/flygym) to program [NeuroMechFly 2.0](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.18.556649v3) (a digital twin of the adult fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster*) to interact with the environment and perform complex behaviors.
## Getting started
To begin with the course materials, ensure you have Git, conda, and the FlyGym Python package installed.
### Installing Git
Git is essential for version control and collaboration. Download and install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
### Installing conda
conda simplifies Python environment management. For a minimal installation, install conda using Miniconda.

Link to graphical installers:
- Windows: https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe
- macOS (Apple Silicon): https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.pkg
- macOS (Intel-based): https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg

For Linux, refer to the Linux section of https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/#quick-command-line-install
### Installing FlyGym
Visit the [FlyGym installation page](https://neuromechfly.org/installation.html).
### Installing Visual Studio Code
- Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window (or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X` on Windows/Linux and `Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac).
- Search for "Python" and install the Python extension provided by Microsoft.
- Search for "Jupyter" and install the Jupyter extension provided by Microsoft.

If you encounter any issues during the installation, feel free to reach out to the TAs.
